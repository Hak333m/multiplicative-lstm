#  An implementation of mLSTM
+ MultiplicativeLSTMCell.py

The core is written by tam17aki, 
https://github.com/tam17aki/multiplicative-lstm-tensorflow

His implementation is based on the following paper:

Ben Krause, Liang Lu, Iain Murray, and Steve Renals, "Multiplicative LSTM for sequence modelling, " in Workshop Track of ICLA 2017, https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJCS5rXFl&noteId=SJCS5rXFl
+ mLSTM.py

This is an implementation which uses mLSTM to predict the next character of a sentence.
